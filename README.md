# Reinforcement Learning Training

For the purpose of self-developement multiple reinforcement learning algorithms were developed from scratch. Some of these algorithms were tested in **Pacman** game. The following repository can be split into three parts:
- Theoretical aid - as the source of knowledge and basis for the developed algorithms.
- Code - with all the scripts written.
- Reports - just the notebooks displaying achieved results.

## Developed algorithms
1. Policy evaluation, policy iteration, value iteration
2. Q-Learning, SARSA, Expected SARSA
3. Sarsa \lambda, Double Q-Learning
4. Deep Q-Network
5. Double Deep Q-Network
6. Reinforce
7. Actor-Critic

## Tested with Pacman
- Value Iteration
- Approximation Q-Learning
- QLearning
- Deep Q-Network
